Made with .net 4.0

Prebuilt binary is in bin/Release

Chipifier converts wav files to samples suitable for use in PCE chiptuning in deflemask

Make sure sox is installed first (into %PATH% or into bin/Release)

Look in the bin/Release folder and drag a small, mono 16bit wave file onto chipify.bat

It will automatically be downsampled and broken into deflemask compatible sample files.
